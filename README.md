## CANN
CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks) is a heterogeneous computing architecture launched by Ascend for AI scenarios. It supports multiple AI frameworks and serves AI processors and programming. It plays a key role in connecting the upper and lower levels and is a key platform for improving the computing efficiency of Ascend AI processors. At the same time, it provides efficient and easy-to-use programming interfaces for diverse application scenarios, supporting users to quickly build AI applications and businesses based on the Ascend platform.<br>
<br>
Ascend-CANN image is based on Ubuntu OS or openEuler OS, and integrates system packages, Python and CANN (Toolkit development kit package, Kernels operator package, NNAL acceleration library). Users can install the artificial intelligence framework based on this basic image according to actual needs and run the corresponding business programs.

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links
The tag of each Ascend CANN docker image is consist of the version of CANN and the version of basic image. The details are as follows

-	[`8.1.RC1.alpha002-910b-openeuler24.03-py3.10`](https://github.com/Ascend/cann-container-image/blob/main/cann/8.1.RC1.alpha002-910b-openeuler24.03-py3.10/Dockerfile)
-	[`8.1.RC1.alpha002-910b-ubuntu24.04-py3.10`](https://github.com/Ascend/cann-container-image/blob/main/cann/8.1.RC1.alpha002-910b-ubuntu24.04-py3.10/Dockerfile)

## Usage

### Quick start 1: supported devices
- Atlas A2 Training series (Atlas 800T A2, Atlas 900 A2 PoD, Atlas 200T A2 Box16, Atlas 300T A2)
- Atlas 800I A2 Inference series (Atlas 800I A2)

### Quick start 2: setup environment using container

```bash
# Assuming your NPU device is mounted at /dev/davinci1 and your NPU driver is installed at /usr/local/Ascend:
docker run \
    --name cann_container \
    --device /dev/davinci1 \
    --device /dev/davinci_manager \
    --device /dev/devmm_svm \
    --device /dev/hisi_hdc \
    -v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
    -v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
    -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
    -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
    -v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
    -it ascend/cann:tag bash
```

### Note:
Configure the abi parameter when executing the CANN environment variable script `/usr/local/Ascend/nnal/atb/set_env.sh`:<br>
<br>
**Automatic configuration**: When executing the set_env.sh script, if no parameters are added and the PyTorch environment has been detected, the `torch.compiled_with_cxx11_abi()` interface will be automatically called to automatically select the abi parameter when PyTorch is compiled as the abi parameter of ATB. If the PyTorch environment is not detected, abi=1 is configured by default.<br>
<br>
**Manual configuration**: When executing `set_env.sh`, users are supported to specify the abi parameter of ATB through the `--cxx_abi=1` and `--cxx_abi=0` parameters.<br>
<br>
In CANN 8.1.RC1.alpha002 and later versions of the image, use ENV to define ATB's `abi=1` (by default, it is processed as if no PyTorch environment is detected), and re-source `/usr/local/Ascend/nnal/atb/set_env.sh` when starting the container in Bash Shell mode to ensure that the value of the abi parameter is correct. However, if you start the container in other ways, the value of abi is 1. If it does not meet the requirements, you can manually specify the abi parameter value of ATB.
